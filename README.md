# Titanic Kaggle Submission

## General Description

This project aims to solve a classification problem using data analysis, preprocessing, and machine learning model evaluation techniques. In this practice, we work with the Titanic passenger database, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), and our goal is to predict the `Survived` variable, indicating whether a passenger survived the sinking.



### Objectives

- Apply classification techniques, data imputation, and cross-validation.

- Compare classification models and perform hyperparameter tuning.

- Implement a detailed evaluation of the results obtained for the different models.



## Practice Contents

The practice is structured into several key sections:



1. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**

   - Initial analysis of data size and type.

   - Evaluation of correlations and analysis of the target variable.

2. **Preprocessing**

   - Removal of null values and data imputation.

   - Encoding of categorical variables and normalization.

3. **Metric Selection**

   - Identification of the most suitable metrics for the problem.

   - Visualization of ROC/AUC curves to evaluate model accuracy.

4. **Model Selection and Cross-Validation**

   - Selection of the optimal model and hyperparameter tuning.

5. **Final Analysis**

   - Evaluation of the selected models and analysis of results.
